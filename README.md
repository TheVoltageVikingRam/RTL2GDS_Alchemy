# ‚ö° RTL2GDS_Alchemy

`RTL2GDS_Alchemy` is a collection of modules and experiments that document my journey through the **VSD-IAT SoC Tapeout Program**, demonstrating hands-on proficiency in the **RTL-to-GDSII physical design flow** using open-source tools.  

This repository is a practical showcase of how a digital design moves from **RTL (Register Transfer Level)** all the way to a **GDSII layout**, ready for fabrication.
