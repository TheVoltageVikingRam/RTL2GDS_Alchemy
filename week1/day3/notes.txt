Combinational logic optmisation

Squeezing the logic to get the most optmized deisgn
-Area and power savings

Constant propagation
-Direct optmization

Boolean Logic Optmization
assign y = a?(b?c:(c?a:0)):(!c)

optmized one
y=(a^c);

Sequential Logic Optimization
-Basic
-Advancement
-state optimization
-Retiming
-Seuqntial Logic Cloning (Floor plan aware synthesis)

Sequential Constant 
State optimization---> Optimization of unused states
Cloning [Physical aware synthesis)              Retiming
