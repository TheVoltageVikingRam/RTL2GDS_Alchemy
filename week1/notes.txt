Synthesizer
Tool used for converting the RTL to netlist
Yosys is the synthesizer used in this course

NETLIST
            =====> iverilog=======> vcd file ----->gtkwave (should be same as output observed during RTL simulation)
TESTBENCH

The set of primary inputs /  primary outputs will remain same between the RTL design and the sythesized netlist ===> same testbench can be used.

RTL design
-RTL design
 --Behavioural representation of the required speicification

module sample_code ( 
input clk, rst, 
output result, done);

always @ (posedge clk, posedge rst)
if (rst)

else

Synthesis

-RTL to Gate level
translation

-The design is converted into gates and the connections are made between
--This is given out as a file called netlist

What is .lib

.lib
-collection of logical modules.
-includes basic gates like And, Or, Not etc.
-Different flavors of the same gate
-2 input And gate
-Slow
-Medium
-Fast

-3 input And gate
-Slow
-Medium
-Fast

-4 input And gate

Why do we need different flavours of gate

- Combinational delay in logic path determines the maximum speed of operation of logic circuit
-So we need cells that work fast toTcomi small
`Are faster cells sufficient?
